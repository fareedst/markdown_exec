# Demo wrapping long lines

MDE detects the screen's dimensions: height (lines) and width (characters)

If `select_page_height` is positive, the height of the MDE menu is fixed. Otherwise, the height is derived from the screen's height.

Normal document text is displayed as disabled menu lines. The width of these lines is limited according to the screen's width.
